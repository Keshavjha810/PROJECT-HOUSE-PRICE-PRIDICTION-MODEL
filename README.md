This project aims to utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to 
develop a predictive model for real estate prices in Bengaluru, India. The primary 
objective is to facilitate informed decision-making in the housing market by 
accurately forecasting property prices. The dataset used in this project comprises 
comprehensive details of residential properties in Bengaluru, including key 
features such as location, size, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and 
price. Through meticulous data preprocessing, outlier removal, and feature 
engineering, the dataset is prepared for modeling. 
 
Linear Regression is employed as the primary algorithm for price prediction, 
validated using cross-validation techniques, and further optimized using 
GridSearchCV for enhanced model performance. This methodology ensures the 
development of a robust predictive model capable of providing valuable insights 
into the Bengaluru real estate market. The project's contribution lies in its ability 
to offer accurate price predictions, thereby empowering stakeholders, including 
buyers, sellers, and investors, to make well-informed decisions. Additionally, it 
demonstrates proficiency in data analysis and machine learning techniques, 
underscoring the potential for leveraging advanced analytical tools to address 
complex challenges in the housing sector. 
 
Overall, this project serves as a testament to the efficacy of data-driven 
approaches in transforming traditional industries like real estate, enabling 
stakeholders to navigate the market landscape with greater confidence and 
precision.
